// Day 2: Operators Tasks/Activities:

// Activity 1: Arithmetic Operations
// • Task 1: Write a program to add two numbers and log the result to the console. 

let addition = 10 + 10
console.log(addition);

// Task 2: Write a program to subtract two numbers and log the result to the console.

let substract = 10 - 30
console.log(substract);

// • Task 3: Write a program to multiply two numbers and log the result to the console.

let multiply = 3* 10
console.log(multiply);

// • Task 4: Write a program to divide two numbers and log the result to the console.

let divide = 10 / 2
console.log(divide);

// • Task 5: Write a program to find the remainder when one number is divided by another and log the result to the console.

let remainder = 11 % 2
console.log(`Remainder value ${remainder}`);


// Activity 2: Assignment Operators
// Task 6: Use the += operator to add a number to a variable and log the result to the console.

addition += 10
console.log(`Assignment operator ${addition}`);

// • Task 7: Use the -= operator to subtract a number from a variable and log the result to the console.

substract -= 5
console.log(`assignment operator ${substract}`);


// Activity 3: Comparison Operators
// • Task 8: Write a program to compare two numbers using > and < and log the result to the console.

console.log(addition < substract);


// • Task 9: Write a program to compare two numbers using > and <= and log the result to the console.

console.log(addition >= addition);


// • Task 10: Write a program to compare two numbers using == and === and log the result to the console.

let num1 = 10
let num2  = 10

console.log(num1 === num2);


// Activity 4: Logical Operators
// • Task 11: Write a program that uses the && operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console. 

if(num1 === 10 || num2 === 5){
    console.log('dono ma sa ak condition some ha');
}

if(num1 === 10 && num2 === 20){
    console.log('dono condition ha');
}
